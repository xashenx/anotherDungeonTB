# Welcome to Another Dungeon Telegram Bot!

Another Dungeon Telegram Bot is based on the Dungeon Bot made by Euphe (https://github.com/Euphe/dungeon_bot) and is a telegram bot utilising Telegram bot API(https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) via https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-telegram-bot/2.2.

Quoting the description made by the original author:

"The purporse of the bot is to create a multiplayer dungeon crawling text rpg. Imagine a simplified diablo with nothing but combat, loot and leveling up."

Keeping the same attitude of the creator,
the bot was developed with versatility in mind. That means that you can contribute! 
You can very easily add a monster, item, perk or effect.
You can add much more complex stuff and make changes to the engine too.

Good luck in the dungeons!
